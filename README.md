# TerminalBadApple

## Quick description
This is a simple recreation of Bad Apple in a terminal instance.
Any computer with more than 150 MB of spare RAM should be able to run this.

## How do I run this?
First of all, you need to have [python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Then, you have to install the required libraries. Here is a simple copy-paste command for you (not sure this runs on windows, but don't care + didn't ask)
```
pip install simpleaudio opencv-python
```
If that doesn't work, try the following
```
pip3 install simpleaudio && pip3 install opencv-python
```

You are now ready to run the code. Just open the folder with your favourite terminal emulator and run `python main.py`, or if that doesn't work, `python3 main.py`
